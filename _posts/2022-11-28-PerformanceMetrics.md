Utility functions offer a way to quantify how much value you get form a certain ammount of a given activity. 

## Performance metrics for different circumstances
### Training
Training is one of those activities that becomes easy to cheat at unless you are careful. Dragging your ass to the gym and checking your phone for 2 hours does not constitute a sufficient workout. A good way to establish robust KPIs is to tie them to some form of minimum criteria. This might be that you need to engage in group sports (during which your friends will be there to push you), or they might be tied to some minimum effort threshold (running at a specific pace, lifting above a certain weight). Some examples of KPIs are: 
* Number of hours engaging in a group sport
* Number of hours running 

### Sleep
* Average amount of sleep per night
* Number of nights that you slept more than 8 hours
* Proximity to a fixes sleep and wake-up schedule

### Diet
The diet category has a tendency to become a large burden in terms of tracking. A popular strategy amongst bodybuilders and other athletes is to count calories as well as nutritional value of their meals. Consistency is another important aspect of dieting - and it might therefore be worthwhile to track the times at which you are eating. Some example KPIs are: 
* Average number of calories per day
* Deviation from scheduled eating times.
