Utility functions offer a way to quantify how much value you get form a certain ammount of a given activity. 

## Generic linear utility function

The generic linear utility funcion gives you a highly flexible way to define the utility of your activities. It forms a utility function by binding together different point that the user specifies. This is illustrated in the following figure:

Note that the utility function binds together all the specified points. Also note that the tility function continues in both directions beyond the specified points. 

You can give the generic linear utility function as many points as you want. This allows the user to create a huge set of utility funcitons. 

## Normal CDF utility function

Normal CDF utility function is less flexible in its shape, but provides a very smooth utility increase compared to the generic linear utility funcion

This utility funciton is appropriate for most activities that follow a [diminishing return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns) structure.
