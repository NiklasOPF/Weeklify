Utility functions offer a way to quantify how much value you get form a certain ammount of a given activity. 

## Generic linear utility function

The generic linear utility funcion gives you a highly flexible way to define the utility of your activities. It forms a utility function by binding together different point that the user specifies. This is illustrated in the following figure:

Note that the utility function binds together all the specified points. Also note that the tility function continues in both directions beyond the specified points. 

## Normal CDF utility function

Normal CDF utility function gives a very smooth utility increase compared to the generic linear utility funcion
